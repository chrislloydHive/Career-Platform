Write a warm, insightful 4-5 paragraph summary that includes:

1. **Opening Hook** - Start with something specific you noticed about how they think or approach decisions (not generic)

2. **Cognitive Pattern** - Describe their unique thinking style and what this reveals about them professionally

3. **Professional Superpower** - Identify their standout strength that makes them uniquely valuable

4. **Career Implication** - What this means for the types of roles/environments where they'll thrive

5. **Opportunity Statement** - End with an empowering statement about their career potential

TONE:
- Conversational but insightful
- Specific, not generic
- Make them feel seen and understood
- Professional but warm
- Avoid clich√©s and buzzwords

Write in second person ("you"). Make it feel like you really understand who they are.`;
