- **Medium:** Either trusted source OR strong keyword matches
- **Low:** Limited source credibility and keyword relevance

### Data Freshness
Tracked for each insight:
- **Current:** Updated within 6 months
- **Recent:** Updated within 6-12 months
- **Outdated:** Over 12 months old

### Source Attribution
Every insight includes:
- Source name

## Usage Examples

### Enhance Database Career with Web Data
```typescript
import { hybridCareerService } from '@/lib/web-search/hybrid-career-service';

const enhanced = await hybridCareerService.getEnhancedCareerData('career-id');
console.log(enhanced.enrichmentScore); // 0-100
console.log(enhanced.dataFreshness); // 'current' | 'recent' | 'outdated'
console.log(enhanced.liveInsights); // Market insights array
```

### Search with Hybrid Data
```typescript
const results = await hybridCareerService.searchCareers(
  'machine learning',
  true // include web data
);

console.log(results.existingCareers); // Database + enriched
console.log(results.emergingRoles); // Web-only discoveries
```

### Get Comprehensive Insights
```typescript
import { careerWebSearchService } from '@/lib/web-search/career-search-service';

const insights = await careerWebSearchService.getComprehensiveCareerInsights(
  'Product Manager',
  'New York, NY'
);

console.log(insights.trends); // Market trends
console.log(insights.salary); // Salary data
console.log(insights.lifestyle); // Day-in-life info
console.log(insights.skills); // Skills requirements
```

## Future Enhancements

2. **Caching Layer:** Implement Redis/memory cache for frequently searched roles
3. **Machine Learning:** Use ML to improve relevance scoring and insight extraction
4. **User Feedback:** Allow users to rate insight quality
5. **Personalized Insights:** Tailor insights based on user profile and preferences

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Natural Language Queries:** "Show me high-paying remote jobs in tech"
2. **Trend Alerts:** Notify users when their careers of interest show market changes
3. **Comparison Tool:** Side-by-side comparison of database vs. live market data
4. **Export Enhancement:** Include web insights in exported career research

## Technical Notes

### Current Limitations
- Web search currently uses mock data for demonstration
- No rate limiting implemented for API endpoints
- Results not cached (every request is fresh)
- Limited to text-based insights (no images/videos)

### Performance Considerations
- Web searches can take 2-5 seconds per query
- Multiple parallel searches used for comprehensive insights
- Consider implementing pagination for large result sets
- Background jobs could pre-populate insights for popular careers

### Security Considerations
- All external URLs open in new tabs with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`
- No sensitive user data sent to web search endpoints
- Input sanitization on all search queries
- CORS policies enforced on API routes

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Visit `/careers/emerging` and search for "AI careers"
- [ ] Open any career in explorer and check "Live Market Data" tab
- [ ] Verify insights load and display properly
- [ ] Test refresh functionality
- [ ] Check confidence indicators and source links
- [ ] Verify emerging roles discovery works
- [ ] Test category filters in live insights
- [ ] Confirm error handling for failed searches

### API Testing
```bash
# Test web search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/web-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "data scientist salary", "maxResults": 3}'

# Test career web search
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/career-web-search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roleName": "Software Engineer", "focusAreas": ["salary", "trends"]}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Insights not loading:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Confirm network requests complete successfully

**Empty search results:**
- Try broader search terms
- Check API response for error messages
- Verify database has seeded career data

**Slow performance:**
- Reduce number of focus areas in requests
- Implement caching for frequently searched roles
- Consider background job for pre-fetching popular careers
